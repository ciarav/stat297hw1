A “title” section which should at least include:
A title (e.g. Homework 1)
The authors
The date (think of using Sys.time())

## Introduction

A section called “Introduction” where you provide a short summary of the structure of your homework. Moreover, record a short video to introduce your group and include it in your R Markdown document.

## Group Members

A section called “Group Members”. This sections should have one sub-section for each group member in your team. For example, a group with three members should have three biographies in total. Each of these sub-sections (named after each group member) should include small biographies containing at least the following elements:

## R Markdown syntax

A section called “R Markdown Syntax”, where you will demonstrate your R Markdown skills! In this section make sure to:

Show an example where the chunk option cache = T leads to a misleading answer. This example must be different from the one presented in the textbook.
Simulate 100 random samples from a standard normal distribution using the function rnorm(). Store these 100 values in a vector called x. Then, compute the empirical median, mean and variance of x. Are these results different from 0, 0 and 1 (their respective theoretical values)? Is this result surprising? Justify your answer.
Include a graph showing the histogram of x (make sure to include a caption to this figure), this can be done in R using the function hist().
Include the equation below:
𝔼[var{v1(θ̂,n)∣∣θ̂}]=var{v1(θ0,n)}+𝔼[p{D1(θ∗,n)(θ̂−θ0),…,Dp(θ∗,n)(θ−θ0)}]=var{v1


Include the following in-line equation: A≡[ai,j]i,j=1,…,p

Include the following text in blue: “Vérité dans un temps, erreur dans un autre.”, Charles de Montesquieu
Include a “More info” button with hide/unhide functionality such as: More info
Include a “color box” such as the one below:
